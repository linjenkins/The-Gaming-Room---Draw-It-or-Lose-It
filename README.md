# The Gaming Room - Draw It or Lose It

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, Gaming Room, has a game called "Draw It or Lose It" which is currently only available on the Android platform. To expand their reach, they want to make their game web-based. Ultimately, by making their game accessible across multiple platforms, they aim to increase their user base and revenue. The requirements included accommodating multiple teams and players, unique game and team names, and efficient memory usage through design patterns.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
In developing the documentation, I researched various operating systems to inform decisions and improved my attention to project details despite some mistakes. In addition, I could see the bigger picture, integrating memory, storage, and network. Furthermore, it helped me have a better understanding of what was needed to meet the client’s goals. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
One thing that I found helpful during the process of working through a design document was guiding the code development process. It clearly established definitions and clients' needs. In addition, it also assisted in selecting appropriate design patterns based on the client’s personal preferences. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, I would focus more on developing the application than just the server-side concerns. I would address more technical aspects to ensure a better understanding for clients.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting user needs and integrating them into software design goes beyond understanding requirements. It involves understanding the users, making the design user-friendly, and aligning features with their goals. This ensures a seamless experience, promotes satisfaction and boosts productivity. Considering user needs is vital for user satisfaction, efficiency, and fostering innovation. In essence, user-centric design enhances the software's value and user loyalty.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In designing software, I followed a systematic approach by mapping design patterns and referring to a comprehensive design document. To enhance this process, I intend to focus on analyzing potential challenges in more detail and developing corresponding solutions during the design phase. Additionally, I'll prioritize incorporating user feedback and usability testing for a more user-centric outcome.
